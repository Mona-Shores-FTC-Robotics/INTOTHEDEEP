//TODO: Create basic opmode to understand how Color Sensor works (look at sample)
// - can you make a basic mechanism that does three different things depending on whether its red, blue thing if it detects red,
// - how should the color sensor be integrated into our robot?
// - https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/configuring_color_sensor/configuring-color-sensor.html'
// - https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/configuring_color_sensor/configuring-color-sensor.html#configuring-a-color-distance-sensor-instructions

// TODO Should we try to do the same thing with a camera to see if the camera or the color sensor is faster / more accurate?
//  - https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/configuring_external_webcam/configuring-external-webcam.html
//  - also take a look at our ObjectClasses/RobotSubsystems/Vision folder

//TODO: Octoquad - REV through bore encoder
// - experiment with this and understand how absolute encoder mode works
// - how is this helpful?
// - how should we integrate this into our robot?

// TODO Organization
//  - How can we better organize the code so everyone understands and it and can follow along?
//  - add helpful todos where we need to improve code or where you do not understand something
//  - for example, //TODO Please explain this!

// TODO Intake
//  - Go see what the hardware folks are working on, is it an active intake?
//  - Look at our Intake code and see if we will be able to use it/adapt it
//  - Will our IntoTheDeep intake use a motor or a servo? What does the code from last year use?
//  - Look at TeamCode/RobotSubsystems/Intake

// TODO Endgame
//  - What does this class do?
//  - What is a Winch? Are we going to be using one this year?
//  - Do we have a climber?
//  - Can you set up this code to be ready for IntoTheDeep climbing?

// TODO Arm
//  - What does this class do?
//  - What parts does it have?
//  - How should we set up this class for IntoTheDeep?
